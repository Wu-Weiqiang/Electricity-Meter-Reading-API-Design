# ⚡ Electricity Meter API

> A Flask-powered API for managing and analyzing electricity meter readings 🌟

## 🎯 Features

- 📊 Get all meter readings by meter ID
- 📈 Calculate monthly averages for specific meters
- 🔍 Easy-to-use test interface with clickable buttons
- 🎨 Pretty JSON responses for better readability

## Assumptions
- Server maintenance will only happen during 0000-0100.
- Meter will only be installed more than 1 hour before the start of server maintenance.
- When server crash, server recovery will start to run.
- When meter reading comes into the server is cumulative and positive number.
- The last line of csv in daily and monthly csv will be the latest reading.

## Installation Guide for Backend
- Step 1: Run this code in the terminal

```
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
```
- Step 2: Run this in the terminal
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
- Step 3: Run this in terminal
```
python app.py
```

- Step 4: Make server public
```
Make the port public in order to use reqbin.
```

## How to use the API

1. Run `python app.py` to start the server. Take note of the server URL, e.g `http://127.0.0.1:5000`/. If you are using Codespaces, the URL will be whatever the URL of your Codespaces is in the browser - it ends with `...github.dev/`, and you can append the rest of the API to the end, e.g. `github.dev/register`
2. Go to [reqbin](https://reqbin.com/#pills-req-content)
3. Send requests from reqbin.
